# US Medical Insurance Project
 
In this Python data analysis project, I wanted to demonstrate the various skills I have learned while progressing through the Codecademy Data Science: Analytics Specialist Career Path. 

## Introduction

In this project, I worked with medical insurance data from the `insurance.csv` dataset. I started by looking through the data to see if it was complete, what types of variables I would be working with, and start asking questions. After reading in the **CSV** file into Python, it revealed that each patient had seven different attributes . . .

* Age (discrete quantitative)
* Sex (qualitative)
* BMI (continuous quantitative)
* Number of Children (discrete quantitative)
* Smoker (qualitative)
* US Geographical Region (qualitative)
* Annual Medical Costs (continuous quantitative)

The dataset appeared to be clean and complete, with every patient attribute containing a value without any inconsistencies to address. The basic questions I wanted answered first included . . .

* What is the average age, BMI, number of children, medical costs of the patients in the sample?
* Is there any skew to the distribution of the data?
* How are the patients distributed amongst the categories?
	* How many males and females are in the sample?
	* How many smokers and non-smokers are there?
	* Are the patients evenly distributed throughout the US geographical regions?
